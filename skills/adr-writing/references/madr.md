# MADR templates

[MADR](https://github.com/adr/madr) is an optional, richer alternative to this skill's default Nygard format. Adopt it only when the repository explicitly chooses MADR; do not mix these fields into generated Nygard ADRs. MADR's upstream convention uses `docs/decisions/` and `nnnn-title`; this skill's default remains `docs/adrs/` with Nygard.

The full template supports removable metadata (`status`, `date`, `decision-makers`, `consulted`, and `informed`), Context and Problem Statement, optional Decision Drivers, Considered Options, Decision Outcome, optional Consequences and Confirmation, optional Pros and Cons of Options, and optional More Information. The minimal template requires a title, Context and Problem Statement, Considered Options, and Decision Outcome; Consequences are optional. Status examples include Proposed, Rejected, Accepted, Deprecated, and Superseded by ADR-0123.

## Full template
