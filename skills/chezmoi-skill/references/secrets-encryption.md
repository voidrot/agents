# Secrets and encryption

Official documentation reviewed: [encryption overview](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/encryption/), [age](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/encryption/age/), [GPG](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/encryption/gpg/), [password managers](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/password-managers/), and the [encryption FAQ](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/frequently-asked-questions/encryption/).

## Choose the right mechanism

- **Password-manager template functions:** Use when the target needs a secret but the source repository must not contain it. The relevant provider CLI must be installed and authenticated on every target machine.
- **Encrypted source files:** Use when a file itself must be versioned in source state. Configure and verify the encryption mechanism before adding a file with `--encrypt`.

Do not echo, log, commit, or place plaintext secret values into `.chezmoidata.*`, the config file, shell history, test fixtures, or skill output. Never ask a user to paste a real secret into a command line.

## Encrypted files

```sh
chezmoi add --encrypt ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chezmoi edit-encrypted ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Supported mechanisms include age, GPG, git-crypt, and transcrypt. For age keys, use `chezmoi age-keygen --output="$HOME/key.txt"` only with an appropriate protected key location and user approval. Built-in age does not support passphrases, symmetric encryption, or SSH keys; use the documented external-age approach if one of those is required.

Test normal rendered target output with `chezmoi diff` and a dry-run apply. Be aware that external age passphrase mode can prompt on `add`, `apply`, `diff`, and `status`.

## Password-manager templates

Provider-specific functions include 1Password, Bitwarden, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, pass, gopass, KeePassXC, Vault, and others. Use only the provider that the user already selected or has installed. A representative 1Password expression is:

```gotemplate
{{ onepasswordRead "op://Personal/item/password" }}
```

The expression itself is not portable across providers. Consult the provider-specific official page before writing it. Rendered output may contain a secret, so use safe redirection/inspection practices and do not include it in reports.
