# GitOps Workflow

Use this skill when implementing GitOps practices, automating Kubernetes deployments, or setting up declarative infrastructure management.

## Workflow

1. Identify the target environment, tool version, and operational constraints.
2. Inspect existing repository configuration before proposing new files or commands.
3. Apply the smallest safe change or produce a concrete implementation plan.
4. Validate with the relevant non-interactive command, linter, dry run, or review checklist.
5. Report assumptions, risks, and follow-up tasks clearly.

## Safety Rules

- Prefer official documentation for version-specific syntax and behavior.
- Keep generated configuration minimal, reproducible, and project-specific.
- Call out destructive commands, credential handling, and production-impacting changes before use.

## Supporting Material
- `references/argocd-setup.md` — detailed argocd setup guidance.
- `references/source-guide.md` — detailed source guide guidance.
- `references/sync-policies.md` — detailed sync policies guidance.
